Follow these steps after the [prerequisites](./prerequisites) are in place:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato.git
   cd open-mercato
   ```
2. **Install workspace dependencies**
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
3. **Bootstrap everything with one command**
   ```bash
   yarn mercato init
   ```
   This script prepares module registries, generates/apply migrations, seeds default roles, and provisions an admin user.
4. **Launch the app**
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/backend` and sign in with the credentials printed by `yarn mercato init`.

> 💡 Need a clean slate? Run `yarn mercato init --reinstall`. It wipes module migrations and **drops the database**, so only use it when you intentionally want to reset everything.

For advanced/manual flows (custom migration control, selective seeding, etc.) see the CLI reference in the repository README.
