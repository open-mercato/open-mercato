description: Tools and services required before installing Open Mercato locally.
---

Before cloning the repository make sure the following tools are installed:

- **Node.js 20.18+** – aligns with the runtime requirements. Use `nvm`/`fnm` to switch versions if needed.
- **Yarn (via Corepack)** – enable it once per machine:
  ```bash
  corepack enable
  corepack prepare yarn@stable --activate
  ```
- **Docker & Docker Compose** – required for running PostgreSQL with pgvector and Redis.
- **OpenSSL** – handy for generating random secrets while configuring `.env`.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure at least:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/open-mercato
JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

The pgvector extension is automatically installed in all databases, enabling vector search features out of the box.

Need a refresher on what each environment toggle controls? Review the [System status variables](../framework/operations/system-status#managing-variables) directory for descriptions and defaults before you customize additional flags.

The docs site you are reading lives in `/docs` and has its own dependencies. Install them independently (`pnpm install` or `npm install`) when you want to build or preview the documentation.
