## Database Connection Pooling

Open Mercato relies on PostgreSQL connection pooling to avoid "too many clients" errors. Tune the pool via environment variables to match your deployment footprint.

### Pool Configuration

- `DB_POOL_MIN` — Minimum connections in the pool (default: `2`)
- `DB_POOL_MAX` — Maximum connections in the pool (default: `20`)
- `DB_POOL_IDLE_TIMEOUT` — Idle timeout in milliseconds before a connection is released (default: `30000`)
- `DB_POOL_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT` — Acquire timeout in milliseconds when waiting for a connection (default: `60000`)

### Recommended Settings

Production baseline:

```bash
# Adjust according to PostgreSQL max_connections
DB_POOL_MAX=20
DB_POOL_MIN=5
DB_POOL_IDLE_TIMEOUT=30000
DB_POOL_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT=60000
```

Local development:

```bash
# Smaller pool for local workflows
DB_POOL_MAX=5
DB_POOL_MIN=1
DB_POOL_IDLE_TIMEOUT=10000
DB_POOL_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT=30000
```

If you continue to hit connection limits, verify that background workers and migrations use the same pool settings, and confirm that your database `max_connections` value comfortably exceeds the aggregate pool size across all applications connecting to it.
