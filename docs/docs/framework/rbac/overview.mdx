# RBAC Overview

Open Mercato enforces access control through a two-layer RBAC system: role assignments scoped to organizations/tenants and feature flags that gate specific capabilities. Modules describe the features they expose, and runtime metadata or services evaluate whether a request is allowed.

- **Roles** bundle feature strings. Users inherit role features per organization/tenant.
- **User overrides** (per-tenant) add or revoke individual feature strings without changing roles.
- **Super admin flag** grants all features globally.
- **Organization visibility list** optionally narrows which organizations a user can act on, even if the feature check passes.

## Declaring Features in Modules

Every module must list the features it exposes in `packages/<pkg>/src/modules/<module>/acl.ts` (or `apps/mercato/src/modules/<module>/acl.ts` for app overrides). Export a `features` array with strings following the `<module>.<action>` convention:

```ts
export const features = [
  'auth.users.view',
  'auth.users.create',
  'auth.users.edit',
  'auth.users.delete',
];
```

The generators collect these declarations into `modules.generated.ts`, making them available to admin UIs and DI services. Avoid introducing features dynamically at runtime—keep the list static so tooling can reason about permissions.

## Using Feature Guards in Metadata

Pages, layouts, and API handlers can declare access requirements through colocated metadata files (`page.meta.ts`, `<route>.meta.ts`, etc.) or by exporting `metadata` directly:

```ts
import type { PageMetadata } from '@open-mercato/shared/modules/registry';

export const metadata: PageMetadata = {
  requireAuth: true,
  requireRoles: ['admin'],
  requireFeatures: ['auth.users.edit'],
};
```

- `requireAuth` blocks anonymous access.
- `requireRoles` checks membership in any of the listed roles within the organization.
- `requireFeatures` ensures the caller has every listed feature through roles or user-level grants.

Metadata-driven enforcement keeps module pages independent and discoverable by the auto-generated registry.

## Server-Side Checks in Handlers

When you need conditional logic beyond declarative metadata—such as enabling certain operations on a page—you can use the DI-provided RBAC service. Inject it through handlers or controllers via Awilix:

```ts
const canEdit = await rbacService.userHasAllFeatures(userId, ['auth.users.edit'], {
  tenantId,
  organizationId,
});
```

- Always pass `tenantId` and `organizationId` to respect multi-tenant boundaries.
- Use `userHasAllFeatures` for strict gates. Prefer `userHasAnyFeature` (if exposed) for "at least one" checks.
- Combine RBAC checks with domain validation; denying access early avoids unnecessary database work.

## Designing Features for Modules

Keep module features granular enough to capture real application actions:

- **View / edit / create / delete** patterns work for most CRUD screens.
- Add specific features for sensitive workflows (`billing.invoices.refund`) instead of overloading broad ones.
- If a module exports backend jobs or CLI commands, guard their execution with features to ensure parity with UI access.

When extending another module, declare additional features in your module's `acl.ts`. Features remain scoped to the defining module even if multiple modules contribute to the same UI flow.

## Testing RBAC Behavior

Include feature-aware tests alongside APIs or pages:

- Seed or mock users with explicit features/roles.
- Verify that protected handlers return the expected authorization errors when features are missing.
- Confirm that super admin and feature overrides behave as intended.

Because RBAC relies on generated module metadata, run `yarn generate` whenever you add or remove features before executing tests or type checks.

## Managing ACLs in the admin

Roles aggregate feature flags. Administrators assign features per role in the **Roles** screen, then apply roles to many users at once.

User-level overrides let you fine-tune access for individuals—grant additional features or revoke ones inherited from roles without creating more roles.
