# Workflows Overview

Workflows are automated business processes that coordinate multiple steps, human decisions, and system actions into a cohesive flow. Think of them as digital assembly lines for your business operations—each step performs a specific task, and the workflow orchestrates how information moves from start to finish.

## What Are Workflows?

A workflow is like a recipe for a business process. Just as a recipe has ingredients, steps, and conditions (e.g., "bake until golden brown"), a workflow has:

- **Steps**: Individual tasks that perform specific actions
- **Transitions**: Connections that define how to move between steps
- **Activities**: Automated actions like sending emails or calling APIs
- **Conditions**: Rules that determine which path to take

For example, an approval workflow might start when a purchase request is submitted, route it to a manager for review, send a notification email, and finally mark the request as approved or rejected.

## Key Concepts

### Definitions vs. Instances

- **Workflow Definition**: The template or blueprint for your process. It defines the steps, transitions, and logic but doesn't contain any data.
- **Workflow Instance**: A running execution of a definition with real data. Each time you start a workflow, you create a new instance.

Think of definitions as cookie cutters and instances as the actual cookies.

### Steps

Steps are the building blocks of workflows. Each step represents a stage in your process:

- **START**: Entry point where workflows begin
- **END**: Exit point where workflows complete
- **USER_TASK**: Requires human input or decision
- **AUTOMATED**: Performs automated processing
- **WAIT_FOR_SIGNAL**: Pauses until an external event occurs

### Transitions

Transitions connect steps and define how the workflow moves forward. They can be automatic (immediate) or conditional (based on rules or manual actions).

### Activities

Activities are actions that execute during workflows—sending emails, calling external APIs, updating database records, or publishing events. They're the "verbs" of your workflow.

## When to Use Workflows

Workflows are ideal for processes that:

- **Require multiple steps**: Purchase approvals, onboarding, order fulfillment
- **Involve human decisions**: Review processes, escalations, manual interventions
- **Run over extended periods**: Multi-day processes, scheduled tasks
- **Need audit trails**: Compliance, tracking who did what and when
- **Coordinate multiple systems**: Integrate with external APIs, databases, and services

### Common Use Cases

- **Approval Processes**: Route requests through multiple approvers with escalation rules
- **Order Fulfillment**: Coordinate inventory, shipping, notifications, and payment processing
- **Customer Onboarding**: Guide new customers through setup steps with automated emails
- **Incident Management**: Track issue resolution with assignments, updates, and notifications
- **Content Publishing**: Review, approve, and publish content with multiple stakeholders

2. [**Step Types**](./step-types) - Choose the right step for each task
3. [**Activities**](./activities) - Configure automated actions
4. [**User Tasks**](./user-tasks) - Work with tasks requiring human input

### Quick Navigation

- [**Transitions**](./transitions) - Connect steps with conditional logic
- [**Signals**](./signals) - Handle external events and triggers
- [**Monitoring**](./monitoring) - Debug and track workflow execution

## Architecture

Workflows are built on a state machine architecture that ensures reliable execution, complete audit trails, and support for long-running processes. The engine handles:

- **Event Sourcing**: Every step, transition, and action is logged
- **Compensation**: Automatic rollback when errors occur (saga pattern)
- **Async Activities**: Queue-based execution for long-running tasks
- **Signals**: External triggers that resume waiting workflows

For developers who want to integrate workflows programmatically or extend the engine with custom activities, see the [**Framework Documentation**](/framework/workflows/).
