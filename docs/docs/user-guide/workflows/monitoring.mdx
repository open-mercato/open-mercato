# Monitoring Workflows

Monitoring workflows helps you understand how processes are executing, identify bottlenecks, and debug failures. This guide explains how to view workflow execution and troubleshoot issues.

## Workflow Instances List

The instances list shows all running and completed workflows. Access it via **Workflows → Instances** in the backend interface.

**List Columns:**
- **Instance ID**: Unique identifier for this execution
- **Workflow**: Which workflow definition is running
- **Status**: Current state (RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED, etc.)
- **Current Step**: Where execution is currently paused or stopped
- **Started At**: When the workflow began
- **Completed At**: When the workflow finished (if applicable)
- **Correlation Key**: External identifier (order ID, customer ID, etc.)

**Filtering and Searching:**
- Filter by **Status**: Show only RUNNING, COMPLETED, or FAILED workflows
- Filter by **Workflow ID**: Focus on specific workflow definitions
- Search by **Correlation Key**: Find workflows for a specific order or customer
- Sort by **Started At** or **Completed At**: Find oldest or newest executions

## Instance Detail View

Click an instance to view its details:

### Overview Section

- **Instance ID**: Full unique identifier
- **Workflow Definition**: Name and version
- **Status**: Current state with color-coded badge
- **Current Step**: Which step execution is at
- **Started At** and **Completed At**: Execution timeframe
- **Duration**: How long the workflow has been running

### Workflow Context

View the current workflow data:

```json
{
  "orderId": "order-123",
  "customerId": "cust-456",
  "amount": 150.00,
  "transactionId": "txn_abc123",
  "items": [
    { "productId": "prod-1", "quantity": 2 }
  ]
}
```

This data is accessible to all steps and activities via variable interpolation (`{{context.orderId}}`).

### Execution Timeline

The timeline shows every event that occurred during workflow execution:

- **Step Entered**: Workflow moved to a new step
- **Step Exited**: Workflow left a step
- **Activity Started**: An activity began executing
- **Activity Completed**: An activity finished successfully
- **Activity Failed**: An activity encountered an error
- **Transition Taken**: Workflow moved from one step to another
- **Signal Received**: External signal was sent to the workflow
- **Workflow Started**: Instance began execution
- **Workflow Completed**: Instance finished successfully
- **Workflow Failed**: Instance encountered a fatal error

Each event includes:
- **Timestamp**: When it occurred
- **Event Type**: What happened
- **Event Data**: Additional details (activity output, error messages, etc.)

## Common Statuses

| Status | Description | What to Do |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **RUNNING** | Workflow is actively executing | Normal—workflow is progressing |
| **COMPLETED** | Workflow finished successfully | Review results and context data |
| **FAILED** | Workflow encountered an error and stopped | Debug the error (see below) |
| **PAUSED** | Workflow manually paused by user | Resume or cancel |
| **WAITING_FOR_SIGNAL** | Waiting for external event | Send the expected signal or wait for timeout |
| **WAITING_FOR_ACTIVITIES** | Async activities still processing | Wait for activities to complete |
| **CANCELLED** | Workflow manually cancelled | No action needed |

## Debugging Failed Workflows

When a workflow fails, the instance detail view shows:

### Error Information

- **Error Message**: High-level description of what went wrong
- **Failed Step**: Which step encountered the error
- **Failed Activity**: If an activity caused the failure, its ID and type
- **Stack Trace**: Technical details for developers

**Common Failure Causes:**
- **Activity Timeout**: Activity took longer than configured timeout
- **API Error**: External API returned an error or was unreachable
- **Validation Error**: Data didn't meet expected format or constraints
- **Permission Error**: User or system lacked required permissions

### Example Error Event

```json
{
  "eventType": "ACTIVITY_FAILED",
  "occurredAt": "2024-01-15T10:45:00Z",
  "eventData": {
    "activityId": "call-payment-gateway",
    "activityType": "CALL_API",
    "error": {
      "message": "Payment gateway returned 503 Service Unavailable",
      "code": "NETWORK_ERROR",
      "retryable": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Retry Options

For transient failures (network errors, timeouts), you can:

1. **Manual Retry**: Click **Retry** to re-execute the failed activity
2. **Resume**: Continue the workflow from the failed step
3. **Cancel**: Stop the workflow and mark it as cancelled

> 💡 **Tip**: Configure automatic retries with retry policies to handle transient failures without manual intervention.

[**Learn more about retry policies →**](./activities#retry-policies)

## Performance Monitoring

### Execution Times

View how long each step and activity took to execute:

**Step Duration:**
```
START: < 1ms
review-request: 2 days, 3 hours
send-notification: 1.2s
END: < 1ms
```

**Activity Duration:**
```
send-approval-email: 0.8s
call-payment-gateway: 2.3s
update-order-status: 0.5s
```

**Use Cases:**
- Identify slow steps and activities
- Optimize API calls and database queries
- Set realistic timeouts and SLAs

### Bottleneck Identification

Long-running workflows often stall at:

- **USER_TASK steps**: Waiting for human action (check SLA compliance)
- **WAIT_FOR_SIGNAL steps**: Waiting for external events (check timeout configuration)
- **Slow activities**: API calls or complex computations (optimize or make async)

## Example Execution Log

## Best Practices

### For Workflow Designers

- Add descriptive step and activity names for easier debugging
- Configure meaningful error messages for activities
- Set up retry policies for transient failures
- Use correlation keys to link workflows to external entities

### For Administrators

- Monitor WAITING_FOR_SIGNAL workflows for stale instances
- Review failed workflows regularly to identify systemic issues
- Set up alerts for workflows that exceed expected durations
- Archive old completed workflows to improve performance

### For Developers

- Log activity errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Implement idempotent activities to support retries
- Use structured error codes (not just messages) for programmatic handling
- Test timeout and failure scenarios thoroughly
