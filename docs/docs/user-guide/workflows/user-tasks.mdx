# User Tasks

User tasks are workflow steps that require human intervention—reviewing data, making decisions, or providing input. This guide explains how to work with tasks from a user's perspective.

## User Task Queue

When workflows reach USER_TASK steps, tasks appear in the user's task queue. Access your tasks:

1. Navigate to **My Tasks** in the sidebar
2. View all tasks assigned to you or roles you belong to
3. Filter by status (PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED)
4. Sort by priority, due date, or creation time

**Task List Columns:**
- **Task Name**: Description of what needs to be done
- **Workflow**: Which workflow this task belongs to
- **Status**: Current state (PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, CANCELLED)
- **Assigned To**: Who is responsible (you, a role, or specific user)
- **Due Date**: When the task should be completed
- **Created**: When the task was created

## Viewing Task Details

Click a task to view its details:

**Task Information:**
- **Task Name and Description**: What needs to be done
- **Workflow Context**: Data from the workflow (requester, amount, details)
- **Assignment**: Who can complete this task
- **Form Fields**: Data you need to provide
- **History**: Previous actions and comments

**Actions Available:**
- **Complete**: Finish the task and move the workflow forward
- **Cancel**: Cancel the task (workflow may be canceled or rerouted)
- **Claim**: Take ownership of a role-assigned task
- **Reassign**: Transfer the task to another user

## Completing Tasks

To complete a task:

1. **Review the Information**: Check workflow context and any attached data
2. **Fill Required Fields**: Complete form fields if configured
3. **Make a Decision**: Choose an action (e.g., Approve, Reject)
4. **Add Comments** (optional): Explain your decision
5. **Click "Complete"**: Submit and advance the workflow

**Form Submission:**

If the task has a form schema, you'll see fields to fill:

```json
{
  "decision": "approve",
  "comments": "Budget approved for Q4 2024",
  "amount": 15000
}
```

The form data is merged into the workflow context, making it available to subsequent steps.

## Task Assignment

Tasks can be assigned in three ways:

### Direct Assignment

Task is assigned to a specific user. Only that user can complete it.

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "userTaskConfig": {
    "assignedTo": "user-123"
  }
}
```

**Use When:**
- Specific person must handle the task
- Personal accountability is required
- Task requires domain expertise only one person has

### Role-Based Assignment

Task is assigned to a role. Any user with that role can claim and complete it.

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "userTaskConfig": {
    "assignedToRoles": ["Approvers", "Managers"]
  }
}
```

**Claiming Tasks:**
1. View tasks assigned to your roles
2. Click **Claim** to take ownership
3. Complete the task as normal

**Use When:**
- Any qualified person can handle the task
- Load balancing across a team
- 24/7 coverage required (follow-the-sun model)

### Dynamic Assignment (Assignment Rules)

Task assignment is computed dynamically based on workflow context.

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "userTaskConfig": {
    "assignmentRule": "context.amount > 10000 ? context.managerUserId : context.supervisorUserId"
  }
}
```

**Use When:**
- Assignment depends on request details (amount, type, region)
- Organizational hierarchy matters (assign to requester's manager)
- Complex routing logic

## SLA Tracking

Tasks can have Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that define expected completion times.

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "userTaskConfig": {
    "slaDuration": "2 days"
  }
}
```

**SLA States:**
- **On Time**: Task completed within SLA
- **At Risk**: Task approaching due date (e.g., > 80% of SLA elapsed)
- **Overdue**: Task past due date

**Visual Indicators:**
- Green: On time
- Yellow: At risk
- Red: Overdue

## Escalation

Escalation rules automatically reassign or notify when tasks are overdue.

**Configuration:**

```json
{
  "userTaskConfig": {
    "slaDuration": "2 days",
    "escalationRules": [
      {
        "triggerAfter": "1 day",
        "action": "NOTIFY",
        "notifyUsers": ["manager-user-id"]
      },
      {
        "triggerAfter": "2 days",
        "action": "REASSIGN",
        "reassignTo": "manager-user-id"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Escalation Actions:**
- **NOTIFY**: Send email notification to specified users
- **REASSIGN**: Transfer task ownership to another user or role
- **ESCALATE**: Create a new task for a supervisor or manager

**Use Cases:**
- Ensure timely completion
- Prevent tasks from stalling workflows
- Enforce SLAs and accountability

## Example: Approval Task Workflow

Here's a complete approval workflow with user tasks:

**Workflow Steps:**
1. **START** → Auto-advance
2. **Manager Approval** (USER_TASK) → Assigned to "Managers" role
3. **Director Approval** (USER_TASK) → Assigned dynamically (if amount > $10k)
4. **Approved** (END) → Workflow complete
5. **Rejected** (END) → Workflow complete

**Manager Approval Task:**
```json
{
  "stepId": "manager-approval",
  "stepName": "Manager Approval",
  "stepType": "USER_TASK",
  "userTaskConfig": {
    "assignedToRoles": ["Managers"],
    "formSchema": [
      {
        "fieldName": "decision",
        "fieldType": "select",
        "label": "Decision",
        "required": true,
        "options": ["approve", "reject"]
      },
      {
        "fieldName": "comments",
        "fieldType": "textarea",
        "label": "Comments",
        "required": false
      }
    ],
    "slaDuration": "2 days",
    "escalationRules": [
      {
        "triggerAfter": "1 day",
        "action": "NOTIFY",
        "notifyUsers": ["director-user-id"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**User Experience:**
1. Manager receives email notification of new task
2. Manager opens task, reviews request details (amount, requester, justification)
3. Manager selects "approve" or "reject" and adds comments
4. Manager clicks "Complete"
5. Workflow advances to Director Approval (if required) or ends

## Best Practices

### For Workflow Designers

- Use clear, action-oriented task names (e.g., "Approve Purchase Request", not "Approval")
- Provide all necessary context in the task description
- Set realistic SLAs based on team capacity
- Configure escalation to prevent bottlenecks

### For Task Assignees

- Check your task queue regularly
- Complete tasks promptly to avoid delays
- Add meaningful comments to explain decisions
- Claim role-assigned tasks quickly to prevent duplicates

### For Administrators

- Monitor overdue tasks and escalations
- Review task completion times to optimize SLAs
- Balance workload across team members
- Train users on task completion procedures
