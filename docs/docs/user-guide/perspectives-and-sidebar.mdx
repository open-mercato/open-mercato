title: Perspectives & sidebar customization
description: Save tailored data views and reorganize the backend navigation to match how each team works.

Perspectives remember how you slice data tables, while sidebar customization keeps the admin navigation focused on what the current team needs. Both features respect tenant and organization scope, so every user only sees content they are allowed to operate.

## Perspectives at a glance

- **What they store** – column order & visibility, active filters, sorting, page size, and the last search query.
- **Where they live** – each table with the `Perspectives` toggle (customers, entities, audit logs, etc.) can persist multiple views.
- **Who can use them** – anyone with `perspectives.use`; sharing defaults to roles additionally needs `perspectives.role_defaults`.

## Save a personal perspective

1. Open a data table (for example **Customers → People**) and adjust columns, filters, search, or sorting.
2. Click **Perspectives** in the toolbar to open the left-hand drawer.
3. In _Save current view_, enter a name, decide if it should be your default, and tweak column visibility or order with the arrows.
4. Hit **Save perspective** – the view appears under _My perspectives_. Activate it at any time with **Use**.

Saved perspectives follow you across sessions, tenants, and organizations. Switching scope reloads only the perspectives that were created in that context, so operators never inherit filters from other tenants by mistake.

## Share perspectives with roles

- select **Apply to roles** inside the drawer to publish the current settings for specific roles. You need `perspectives.role_defaults`.
- toggle **Set as role default** to make that view the first thing members of the selected roles see when they open the table.
- use **Clear role** on any entry to remove a previously shared perspective or to hand control back to personal defaults.

Role perspectives can coexist with personal ones: users may adopt the role baseline and still tweak their own defaults without overwriting the shared configuration.

## Customize the sidebar

![Sidebar customization with renamed groups and hidden links](/screenshots/open-mercato-sidebar-customization.png)

1. Open the backend (`/backend`) and click **Customize sidebar** at the bottom of the navigation.
2. Drag groups to reorder sections, rename the entries that matter, and hide rarely used links. Changes preview instantly on the right.
3. Save to persist the layout for your account. Preferences are stored per locale and tenant/organization combination.

To broadcast the layout to roles, pick **Share with roles** before saving. This requires the `auth.sidebar.manage` feature. Role presets cascade to members the next time they sign in; personal overrides remain available for power users who need their own tweaks.

## Tips & troubleshooting

- Run `yarn generate` after pulling new modules to ensure the Perspectives API is generated.
- Clearing cache or signing out does not remove saved perspectives or sidebar layouts; use the drawer actions if you need a clean slate.
- Sidebar drafts include a version marker. If we ship a breaking navigation change, you will be prompted to review and resave.
