The **Cache** page gives operators a tenant-scoped view of CRUD response caches so you can keep long-lived environments tidy and avoid stale reads during development.

## Access

- Navigate to **Backend → Configuration → Cache**.
- Access requires the `configs.manage` feature. The page checks whether you also hold `configs.cache.manage` to unlock purge buttons.

## Reading cache statistics

- The summary card shows when metrics were generated and how many keys are currently stored for the active tenant.
- Each table row represents a cache segment. When the system can map the segment back to an API route you see the HTTP method and path alongside the internal key.
- Use the **Refresh** button any time you suspect another operator or automation invalidated cache entries.

## Clearing segments

- **Purge selected** buttons clear only the highlighted segment and immediately refresh statistics so you can monitor the impact.
- **Purge all** clears every cached entry for the active tenant after a confirmation prompt. The action runs through the shared `/api/configs/cache` endpoint and respects the underlying cache backend (Redis, SQLite, etc.).
- If the cache backend does not support an operation, the UI surfaces a descriptive error and leaves the existing entries untouched.
