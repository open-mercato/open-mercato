title: Vector Search
description: Use the global vector search to jump to customers, notes, deals, and todos across the workspace.
---

The vector module introduces an AI-powered search surface that spans customers, notes, activities, deals, and todos. Results are refreshed automatically whenever indexed records change, and they resolve to the canonical admin pages so you can take action immediately.

## Prerequisites

- Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your `.env`. Without it the module stays visible but all search UIs display a reminder that embeddings are disabled.
- Run `npm run modules:prepare` (or the individual generator scripts) after enabling the module so the dependency injection graph registers the new services and subscribers.
- Optional: reindex historic data once per tenant via the **Reindex vectors** button on the Vector Search page, or by running `yarn mercato vector reindex --tenant <tenantId>` from the CLI. This is only needed the first time after enabling the module; ongoing CRUD operations stream into the vector index automatically.
- Set `DISABLE_VECTOR_SEARCH_AUTOINDEXING=1` when you need to turn off streaming updates across the whole workspace (the toggle described below becomes read-only in that mode).

## Global search palette

- Click the new search icon in the admin header, or press `⌘K` / `Ctrl+K` anywhere inside the backend to open the palette.
- Start typing at least two characters. The dialog shows results as you type and highlights the best match by default.
- Use the arrow keys to move through results. Press `Enter` (or `⌘⏎` / `Ctrl+⏎`) to open the selected item.
- Secondary links—such as deal or todo shortcuts—appear as chips. They are also listed in the row actions menu for quick access.
- Press `Esc` to close the dialog without leaving the current page.

## Data Designer page

- Navigate to **Backend → Data designer → Vector Search** to browse the index in table form.
- The Data Designer table supports free-text search, row actions, and deep links identical to the command palette.
- When `OPENAI_API_KEY` is missing the page surfaces a banner explaining the requirement and keeps the table disabled.
- Use the **Reindex vectors** toolbar button to trigger a full rebuild without leaving the UI.

## Settings & auto-indexing

- Head to **Backend → Configuration → Vector Search** to review the OpenAI status and control auto-indexing.
- The checkbox `Index database changes automatically` is powered by the shared configs module (`vector.auto_index_enabled`). Turning it off pauses the background subscribers that feed new/updated rows into the vector index.
- Updates go through `/api/vector/settings` so you can apply the same change from automations or custom tooling. The endpoint requires the `vector.manage` feature.
- When `DISABLE_VECTOR_SEARCH_AUTOINDEXING` is set, the toggle is locked in the off position and the API returns a `409` response if you try to re-enable it.

## Reindexing options

- From the CLI: `yarn mercato vector reindex --tenant <tenantId> [--entity <module:entity>]`.
- From the UI: **Reindex vectors** on the Vector Search page.
- From the REST API: `POST /api/vector/reindex` (see API reference).

Every mode accepts optional `--org` / `organizationId` scopes and a `--purgeFirst=false` flag when you want to update embeddings in place without clearing the table first.

## What gets indexed?

The first release ships with the following entity coverage:

- Customers (both people and companies) with custom fields, statuses, and primary contact details.
- Customer notes and activities, enriched with the parent account and linked deal metadata.
- Customer deals.
- Todos from the example module, alongside customer todo links (mapped back to the owning customer).

Custom modules can opt-in by exporting a `vector.ts` file alongside their other module metadata. See the framework reference for implementation details.
