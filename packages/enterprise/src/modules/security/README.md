# Security Module (Enterprise Scaffold)

This is the scaffold for enterprise security capabilities, including advanced MFA/2FA.

Planned first implementation area:
- multi-factor authentication (TOTP/passkey/OTP email) and related enforcement/sudo flows.

This scaffold is intentionally minimal and will be expanded incrementally during implementation.
