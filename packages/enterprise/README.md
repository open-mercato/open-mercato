# @open-mercato/enterprise

Enterprise-only package for commercial Open Mercato modules and overlays.

This package is where Enterprise Edition implementations such as advanced MFA/2FA security features are delivered.

## Open Mercato Partnership Program

Build Open Mercato implementations without production risk.

Open Mercato takes responsibility for platform standards, security, and production certification. Partner agencies own delivery, revenue, and the client relationship.

## The Problem We Solve

Enterprise clients do not accept production risk.

Open-source or AI-generated systems without certification create concrete concerns around:
- security
- maintainability
- compliance
- long-term support

In serious enterprise environments, "let's deploy and see what happens" is not acceptable.

## Our Position

Uncertified Open Mercato deployments should not go to production.

Production requires:
- enterprise license
- architecture/security audit
- production approval

This is a production requirement.

## Open Mercato Enterprise License

The Enterprise License includes:
- Pre-Deployment Architecture Audit: structured review for platform best practices and enterprise readiness.
- Monthly Technical Reviews: recurring security review, performance review, and custom module code review (advisory review allocation each month).
- Priority Technical and Customer Success Support: priority helpdesk access and dedicated customer success guidance until production launch.
- Compliance and Environment Support: GDPR guidance/templates and production environment advisory support (including Docker/Kubernetes setup guidance).
- Software Updates: access to Open Mercato security updates and new platform features.
- Production Approval (Homologation): formal pre-go-live readiness assessment with production approval report and risk summary.

Final commercial terms are scoped per client engagement after joint assessment.

## Open Mercato Certified Agencies

Certified agencies serve clients with an Open Mercato license. This supports ecosystem quality and enables deeper go-to-market collaboration.

Certified partners receive:
- Official Certified Open Mercato Agency status
- Ability to deliver production-ready Open Mercato projects
- Qualified leads from Open Mercato (when available)
- Joint enterprise sales narrative support (including case-study/media collaboration)
- Support in winning key clients
- Access to platform expertise and standards

## Roles and Responsibilities

Open Mercato acts as:
- owner of the platform standard
- license provider
- certification authority
- ecosystem enabler

Open Mercato does not deliver client projects and does not compete with partners.

Partner agency is responsible for:
- project delivery
- client relationship
- customization and development
- project-level support

Agencies operate on the front line; Open Mercato stands behind system quality.

## Financial Model

- Delivery: handled by the partner agency.
- Platform and enterprise license: provided by Open Mercato.
- Open Mercato sells the platform license directly to the client.
- Agency owns project delivery revenue, client relationship, and ongoing services revenue.
- If Open Mercato provides the lead, commission terms apply under partner agreement.
