# Preferred script
yarn test:integration:ephemeral:start

# Direct CLI command (alias form)
yarn mercato test:ephemeral

# Direct CLI command (module/command form)
yarn mercato test ephemeral
```

## Options

| `--no-screenshots` | Disables screenshot capture for Playwright sessions. |

## Examples

```bash
# Start ephemeral environment for manual QA
yarn test:integration:ephemeral:start

# Start with verbose setup logs
yarn mercato test:ephemeral --verbose
```

## Runtime Output

When ready, the command prints:

- The ephemeral base URL (for example `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`)
- QA login credentials: `admin@acme.com / secret`
- A reminder to use `Ctrl+C` to stop and clean up

## Requirements

- Node.js `24.x`
