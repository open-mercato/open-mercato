`yarn test:integration:ephemeral:start` executes `yarn mercato test:ephemeral`.

This command boots an isolated environment and keeps it running until you stop it with `Ctrl+C`.

For short integration-development loops, prefer `yarn test:integration:ephemeral:interactive` so you can run many tests without repeated bootstrap.

## Usage

```bash
# Preferred script
yarn test:integration:ephemeral:start

# Direct CLI command (alias form)
yarn mercato test:ephemeral

# Direct CLI command (module/command form)
yarn mercato test ephemeral
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--verbose` | Shows detailed bootstrap/build logs. |
| `--screenshots` | Enables screenshot capture for Playwright sessions. |
| `--no-screenshots` | Disables screenshot capture for Playwright sessions. |
| `--no-reuse-env` | Forces a brand-new ephemeral environment instead of attaching to an existing one. |

## Examples

```bash
# Start ephemeral environment for manual QA
yarn test:integration:ephemeral:start

# Start with verbose setup logs
yarn mercato test:ephemeral --verbose

# Always start a fresh instance on an isolated port
yarn mercato test:ephemeral --no-reuse-env
```

## Runtime Output

When ready, the command prints:

- The ephemeral base URL (for example `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`)
- QA login credentials: `admin@acme.com / secret`
- A reminder to use `Ctrl+C` to stop and clean up

The command also writes environment state to `.ai/qa/ephemeral-env.json`:

- `baseUrl` and `port` for reuse by tools/skills
- Default app port is `5001` when available
- File is cleared automatically when the environment stops

## Requirements

- Node.js `24.x`
- Docker runtime available (`docker info` must succeed)
