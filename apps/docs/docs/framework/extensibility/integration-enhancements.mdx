This page focuses on extension points used to integrate Open Mercato with external systems.

## Payment and shipping gateways

- Register custom providers with `registerPaymentProvider` and `registerShippingProvider`.
- Providers can declare UI settings fields, validation schema, and runtime adjustment calculators.
- Provider settings are persisted and reused in totals calculation.

Start with: [Shipping & payment providers](/framework/modules/sales-providers)

## Messaging as an integration boundary

- Extend `message-types.ts` to define workflow-specific messages.
- Extend `message-objects.ts` to attach domain records (customers, orders, staff, etc.).
- Combine with message actions to trigger commands or links.

Start with: [Messages system](/framework/modules/messages)

## Notifications and inbox delivery

- Add notification definitions in `notifications.ts`.
- Add client renderers in `notifications.client.ts`.
- Emit domain events and subscribe to produce user-facing notifications.

Start with: [Notifications](/framework/modules/notifications), [Events overview](/framework/events/overview)

## Search and vector integrations

- Fulltext integration: implement a compatible fulltext driver.
- Vector integration: configure vector entities and choose vector driver/backend.
- Embedding provider integration supports OpenAI/Google/Mistral/Cohere/Bedrock/Ollama.

Start with: [Hybrid search](/framework/database/hybrid-search)

## Workflow and scheduler integration patterns

- Use workflow activities/signals for external system orchestration.
- Use scheduler jobs for recurring pull/sync integrations.
- Use progress events for UI status during long-running sync jobs.

Start with: [Workflows extending](/framework/workflows/extending), [Scheduler](/framework/scheduler/overview), [Progress](/framework/progress/overview)

## API-level integration hooks

- Route-level interception: `api/interceptors.ts`
- Response composition: `data/enrichers.ts`
- Event-driven side effects: `subscribers/*.ts`
- Long-running processing: `workers/*.ts`

Start with: [API extension guide](/framework/api/extending-api), [Queue workers](/framework/events/queue-workers)

## Data integration and entity mapping today

Currently available:

- Custom entities and custom fields for schema-level adaptation
- Message object type mapping for cross-module record linking
- Query index and search indexing for downstream lookup/search use cases

Planned for UMES 2.09:

- First-class external ID mapping widgets/bindings
- Integration wizard widgets for OAuth/config onboarding
- Query-level transform hooks for integration-specific query shaping

See: [UMES 2.09 roadmap](./umes-2-09-roadmap)
