title: UMES 2.09 Roadmap (Not Extensible Yet)
description: Gaps in current extensibility and the planned UMES 2.09 roadmap.
---

This is the short list of extension capabilities not fully available yet, based on current implementation and UMES phase backlog.

## Not yet extensible (or not first-class yet)

| Gap | Why it matters | Planned UMES track |
|---|---|---|
| Detail-page binding framework (`useExtensibleDetail`) | No unified API to inject typed fields/sections/actions into detail pages with save orchestration | Phase I |
| Recursive widget extension points | Widgets cannot define their own child extension zones in a standardized way | Phase J |
| UMES DevTools and conflict diagnostics | Hard to inspect extension precedence, collisions, and active registrations at runtime | Phase K |
| Integration-first UI blocks (wizard widgets, status badges, external ID presentation) | Integration UX remains mostly custom and repetitive | Phase L |
| Command interceptors (`beforeExecute`, `afterExecute`, undo hooks) | Missing cross-cut command-level policy and audit hooks | Phase M |
| Sync lifecycle subscribers for CRUD stages (`creating`, `updating`, etc.) | No unified event-driven mutation lifecycle interception model | Phase M |
| Query-engine extension hooks (query/result transform + query lifecycle events) | Cannot plug into query pipelines as first-class extensibility points | Phase N |
| Generic external data connector registry ("data integrators") | No built-in connector abstraction for pull/push sync providers yet | Phase L + marketplace specs |
| Integration marketplace hub | Discovery/install governance for integration packages is not productized yet | SPEC-045 series |

## Target outcome for UMES 2.09

UMES 2.09 should make integration and extension work predictable across UI, API, data, and runtime layers, with explicit ordering, diagnostics, and testable contracts for each extension type.
