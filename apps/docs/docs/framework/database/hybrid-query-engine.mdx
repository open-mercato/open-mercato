# Hybrid Query Engine

The query engine can transparently route requests through a denormalised JSONB index. This hybrid approach keeps write operations on the primary tables while enabling fast reads for list and search screens. Its primary target is **user-defined entities** (from the Entities module) which are stored as JSONB documents.

| Entity type | Defined in | Storage | Primary use | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **System entities** | Module `data/entities.ts` (MikroORM) | Relational tables (one per entity) | Core platform objects extended with custom fields | `auth.user`, `directory.organization` |
| **User entities** | Module `ce.ts` / admin UI | JSONB documents in the Entities module | Customer-specific records managed at runtime | `inventory:item`, CRM pipelines |

The hybrid query engine optimises **user entities**, while the [JSONB indexing layer](./query-index) targets **system entities with custom fields** (flattening base columns + `cf:<key>` values). Treat them as complementary mechanisms, not replacements for each other.

## How it works

1. Each entity that opts in gains an `*_index` table storing flattened rows (user entity payloads).
2. Background jobs or CLI commands (`yarn mercato entities install --reindex`) populate and refresh the index.
3. When the index is up to date, the query engine executes filters and sorts against the JSONB payload, bypassing expensive joins.
4. If the index is missing or stale, the query engine automatically falls back to the relational query plan.

## Opting in

```ts title="src/modules/inventory/index.ts"
export const metadata = {
  id: 'inventory',
  title: 'Inventory',
  version: '0.1.0',
  description: 'Track stock levels for sellable items.',
  queryIndex: {
    entities: ['inventory:item'],
  },
};
```

- Add the entity id you want indexed.
- Run `yarn generate` and `yarn db:generate` to create the index tables.
- Trigger an initial backfill (for example, `yarn mercato entities sync-index --entity inventory:item --tenant <tenantId>`).

## Working with custom fields

- User entities: custom fields are already part of the JSONB payload, so the hybrid index copies them verbatim.
- System entities: continue using the [JSONB indexing layer](./query-index) to flatten base columns and `cf:<key>` values. The hybrid index does not replace that mechanism.

## Monitoring freshness

- Inspect `modules.generated.ts` to confirm the entity lists `hybridQuery: true`.
- Each index record carries an `updated_at` timestamp. Use it to detect stale data and schedule incremental refreshes.
- The engine logs when it falls back to relational mode, making it easy to flag missing indexes during development.
- Use the Entities module dashboards to confirm user-entity records stay in sync after edits in the admin UI.

When you need fast lists for system entities enriched with module-defined custom fields, enable the JSONB indexing layer. When you need performant queries over runtime-defined user entities, opt into the hybrid query engine.
