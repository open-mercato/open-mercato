The Open Mercato REST API is auto-discovered from each module under `src/modules/<module>/api`. Every handler is expressed as a standard Next.js `route.ts` module and is wrapped in shared infrastructure that enforces authentication, scoping, and feature checks. Use this page as the launch pad before diving into the detailed module guides.

## Base URL

- Local development: `http://localhost:3000/api`
- Production deployments: `<your-domain>/api`

All paths shown below are relative to the `/api` base.

## Quick Start Environment

```bash
export BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000/api"
export API_KEY="<paste your API key secret here>"
export ORG_ID="<optional active organization id>"
```

`API_KEY` comes from the admin UI table (**Admin → Security → API keys**) or the [`mercato api_keys add`](../cli/api-keys) CLI command. All `curl` examples reuse these variables so you can copy, tweak, and run them immediately.

## Authentication Flow

1. Mint a key from the [Managing API keys guide](../user-guide/api-keys) or via [`mercato api_keys add`](../cli/api-keys). Keys inherit the roles (and therefore features) you assign.
2. Send the secret on every request using either `X-Api-Key: <secret>` or `Authorization: ApiKey <secret>`. The prefix (`omk_live_…`) helps correlate requests with a specific key.
3. Requests lacking a valid API key receive `401 Unauthorized`. Deleted or expired keys behave the same.

Human users still sign in with email/password for the admin UI, but machine-to-machine integrations should rely on API keys for predictable scoping and auditability.

## Feature Gates & Access Control

Each HTTP method exports `metadata` declaring `requireAuth`, `requireRoles`, and `requireFeatures`. The RBAC service evaluates the metadata against the authenticated principal:

- Features are string identifiers (for example `auth.users.list`) exposed by every module under `src/modules/<module>/acl.ts`.
- Users receive features via roles or custom ACLs (`/api/auth/users/acl`). Super administrators bypass feature checks.
- If the caller lacks the declared feature(s), the API returns `403 Forbidden`.

## Tenant and Organization Scoping

- For API keys, tenant and organization scope come from the key metadata. For browser sessions, they originate from the JWT payload (`tenantId`, `orgId`).
- Most entities require an active tenant; requests without one fail with `400` or `403`.
- When a module opts into organization scoping, create/update requests inject the active organization automatically; list requests are filtered to the allowed organizations resolved from RBAC + cookies.
- The `GET /directory/organization-switcher` endpoint returns the organization tree the current user may access. Clients can persist a new selection by setting the `om_selected_org` cookie before subsequent API calls.

Full examples live in the [Directory service guide](./directory).

## Request & Response Conventions

- **Payload format:** JSON bodies unless the handler specifies otherwise (only `/login` expects `multipart/form-data` or `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`).
- **Pagination:** List endpoints accept `page` (default `1`) and `pageSize` (default `50`, max `100` or `200` depending on the handler) and respond with `{ items, total, page, pageSize, totalPages }`.
- **Filtering:** Common filters include `search`, `id`, and module-specific filters such as `roleIds` or `tenantId`. Custom field filters use the `cf_<key>` convention and obey the custom field kind.
- **Sorting:** When powered by the Query Engine, endpoints accept `sortField` and `sortDir` (`asc` or `desc`).
- **Custom fields:** Include values under `customFields` or prefixed keys (`cf_priority`) in create/update payloads. The CRUD factory persists them automatically.
- **Concurrency:** Endpoints are stateless. Optimistic concurrency is handled at the application level.
- **Media types:** Set `Content-Type: application/json` for JSON bodies and `Accept: application/json` on reads to opt into JSON responses.

## Error Semantics & Status Codes

- **2xx** &mdash; Successful operations (`200 OK`, `201 Created`, `204 No Content`).
- **400** &mdash; Validation failures or malformed payloads (`{ "error": "Invalid input" }`).
- **401** &mdash; Missing or invalid credentials.
- **403** &mdash; Authenticated but missing required feature or tenant scope.
- **404** &mdash; Entity not found in the current tenant/organization scope.
- **409** &mdash; Business rule violations (for example deleting a role with assigned users).
- **5xx** &mdash; Unexpected server faults. Inspect server logs; messages are intentionally vague to avoid leaking internals.

## Tooling & Automation

- Use `yarn dev` to boot the stack locally; the API listens on port `3000`.
- `yarn generate` regenerates routing metadata after you add or remove module APIs.
- For integration tests, compose requests with `createRequestContainer()` to reuse the same dependency injection graph as production handlers.
- Use the shared CRUD helpers in `@open-mercato/shared/lib/crud/factory` to ensure consistent pagination, scoping, and event emission logic.

## Documentation & Playground

- `GET /docs/api` opens the OpenAPI Explorer, an interactive playground generated from the live module registry. Access it from the admin UI once signed in, browse every operation, review example payloads, and paste an API token to execute authenticated requests against your chosen base URL.
- `GET /api/docs/openapi` returns the OpenAPI 3.1 JSON document for client generation, contract testing, or syncing external tooling.
- `GET /api/docs/markdown` serves the same specification as Markdown, ideal for quick sharing or feeding into LLM prompts.
