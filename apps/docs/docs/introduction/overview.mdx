Open Mercato is an extensible commerce framework that blends a modular backend, customizable admin UI, and typed data engine. Every capability—from authentication to dashboards—is delivered as an installable module so product teams can add or override functionality without forking the core platform.

## Why teams pick Open Mercato

- **Composable architecture**: Features ship in isolated modules with explicit interfaces, enabling independent development and upgrades.
- **Customizable admin & APIs**: Override any page, scaffold CRUD APIs, and tailor dashboards for your operations teams.
- **Data extensibility**: Add tenant-specific fields, link entities across modules, and query everything through a unified engine.
- **Multi-tenant aware**: Built-in guards and conventions keep data scoped to the right organization or tenant.
- **Type-safe workflows**: Zod-powered validation, DI-driven services, and generated registries keep runtime and design-time aligned.

## What the docs cover

1. **Installation** – get the repository running locally and in the cloud.
2. **Architecture** – learn how modules, DI, and the data engine cooperate.
3. **Customization tutorials** – step-by-step guides for adding modules, APIs, forms, grids, and dashboards.
4. **Framework reference** – deep dives into IoC, routing, database entities, and event-driven workflows.

If you are in a rush, scaffold a standalone project with `npx create-mercato-app my-app` ([guide](/customization/standalone-app)) or jump to [Build your first Open Mercato app](../customization/build-first-app) if you're working inside the monorepo.
