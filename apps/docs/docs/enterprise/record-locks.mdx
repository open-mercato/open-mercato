description: Prevent edit collisions with optimistic or pessimistic locking, live editor presence, and conflict resolution.
---

Record locks help teams avoid accidental overwrites when multiple users edit the same record at the same time.

## Overview

Record locking supports two strategies:

- **Optimistic locking**: Multiple users can edit in parallel, and conflicts are detected when saving.
- **Pessimistic locking**: The first editor gets an exclusive lock until release or timeout.

You can apply locking only to selected resources and tune timeout/heartbeat values.

## Configure record locking

Open **Settings → Record locking** and configure the behavior for your workspace.

Key settings:

- **Enable record locking** to turn the feature on.
- **Strategy** to choose optimistic or pessimistic mode.
- **Lock timeout** and **heartbeat interval** to control stale lock cleanup.
- **Enabled resources** to scope locking to specific resource kinds.
- **Allow force unlock** for administrative lock recovery.
- **Allow overriding incoming changes** to let authorized users keep their version during conflicts.
- **Notify on conflict** to send in-app conflict alerts.

## Live collaboration signals

When another user opens the same record, participants are shown on the record page and notifications are sent.

## Conflict handling

When optimistic locking detects incoming changes, users get a field-level comparison and can choose how to proceed:

- **Accept incoming** to load the newest server state.
- **Keep my changes** to overwrite with your draft (if permitted).
- **Keep editing** to continue adjusting before saving again.

## Access control

If incoming-change overrides are enabled globally, users still need the corresponding ACL/role feature to keep local edits during conflicts.
