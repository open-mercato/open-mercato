title: Fieldsets and groups for custom fields
description: Organize custom fields into reusable fieldsets and groups so editors can pick the right palette per product or record.
---

Fieldsets bundle custom fields into reusable palettes (for example, different attributes for Fashion vs. Services). Groups keep each fieldset tidy, letting merchandisers scan the form quickly.

## Create and configure fieldsets

- Go to **Backend → Entities**, open your entity, and switch to **Field Definitions**.
- Use the **Fieldset** dropdown to pick an existing palette or click **Add** to create one. Set the code, label, icon, and description to help editors choose the right set.
- Enable **Single fieldset per entity** if records should only carry one palette; leave it unchecked to allow multiple fieldsets per record.
- Save. The palette appears in forms and filters anywhere that entity is used.

## Add groups inside a fieldset

Groups are shared sections within a fieldset (e.g., Identity, Materials, Care instructions). They keep long forms readable and can be reused by many fields.

- From **Field Definitions**, open the group picker next to **Group** and click **+**.
- Provide a **Group code** (snake_case), **Label**, and optional **Hint**.
- Review existing groups, edit labels inline, or delete unused ones. Changes apply to all fields that reference the group.

## Assign fields to fieldsets and groups

- When editing a field, choose the **Assign to fieldset** value so the field only appears when that palette is selected.
- Pick a **Group** to place the field under a shared heading; use the gear icon to adjust group settings without leaving the field editor.
- Reorder fields within the fieldset to control the final layout shown to editors.

## Pick fieldsets when editing or filtering records

Editors can switch palettes while editing a record or filtering lists. The available options mirror the definitions you configured.

## Tips

- Keep fieldset codes short and descriptive; use snake_case to align with API payloads.
- Use groups to cluster related attributes (identity, build, care) instead of creating many small fieldsets.
- If you manage definitions in code, include `fieldsets` and `groups` in the payload you send to the Entities API so the UI stays synchronized.
