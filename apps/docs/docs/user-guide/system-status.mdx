description: Monitor runtime flags, cache settings, and profiling toggles for your deployment.

The **System status** page surfaces a live snapshot of environment variables and runtime switches so operators can validate how the backend is configured without shell access.

## Access

- Open **Backend → Configuration → System status**.
- The page requires the `configs.system_status.view` feature. Super administrators inherit it automatically through `configs.manage`.

## What you see

- A banner summarises the current runtime mode (development, production, or test) and when the snapshot was generated.
- Categories cover profiling, logging, caching, query index, and entities. Each variable lists its current value, default, and a quick link out to the environment configuration guide.
- Status badges flag whether a toggle is enabled, disabled, unset, or unknown, making it easy to spot misconfigurations during incident response.

## Purging cache safely

- Users with `configs.manage` can trigger **Purge cache**. The action clears CRUD caches within the active tenant after a confirmation prompt.
- When the configured cache backend does not expose a purge method the UI shows an error instead of attempting a partial clear, so you never get a false success state.
