Catalog editors can manage the core product catalog, publish items to multiple sales channels, and tune pricing per channel or price kind.

## Browse and filter products

Open **Catalog → Products & services** to search the catalog, filter by title or SKU, and jump into editing an item.

## Create or edit a product

1. Click **Create product** (or open any product to edit it). Fill **General data** with the title, description, media, handle, and default tax class.

2. Switch to **Organize** to assign categories, tags, and default sales channels that should receive offers automatically.

3. Use **Variants** when the product has options (e.g., color). Add option values, then set SKUs, tax classes, base prices, and inventory flags per variant.

4. Save. Editing a product reuses the same form, so you can return later to adjust content, pricing, or tax class without recreating variants.

## Manage sales channels

Sales channels define where products are published (e.g., online store, marketplace, in-store POS).

- Open **Sales → Sales channels** to review the list, search, and open channel details.

- In **Settings**, set the channel name, code, description, contact details, and whether the channel is active.

## Add or adjust sales channel offers

Offers customize how a product appears in a specific channel (title, media, pricing, and status).

- From a channel, switch to **Offers** to see the products customized for that channel and add a new offer.

- Use **Sales → Sales channel offers** to review every offer across all channels, search, and filter by price kind.

- When editing an offer, pick the channel and product, override media if needed, and update content or custom attributes.

## How pricing works

Prices cascade so you can set sensible defaults and override only what changes per channel or promotion.

- Base prices live on the product or variant. They provide the starting point for any channel.
- Each offer can set a **Channel price**, shown when no overrides apply.
- Add **Price overrides** per price kind (e.g., Regular, Sale). Overrides take precedence over the channel price while the offer is active.

- Tax class defaults come from the product unless you override them per variant.

## Attachments and media

Use attachments to manage product imagery and other files:

- Upload media while editing a product (in **General data** → **Media**) or from the **Attachments** workspace.
- Assign an attachment to a product or specific offer so the file stays linked to its record.
- Edit attachment metadata to add tags, generate resized URLs, or retarget the assignment without reuploading.
