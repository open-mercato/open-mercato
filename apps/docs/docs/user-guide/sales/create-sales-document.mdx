Use the Create flow to spin up a quote or order in one pass. The form respects your numbering format, dictionaries, and address policies.

## Steps to create

1) **Document type** — choose Quote or Order. The number field follows your configured pattern and sequence; use **Generate** to pull the next value.
2) **Customer** — search or **Create customer** inline. Changing the customer clears addresses to avoid mixing contact data.
3) **Currency** — set per document; totals and adjustments respect this currency.
4) **Addresses** — pick shipping/billing or define new ones. “Same as shipping” keeps billing in sync until you uncheck it.
5) **Custom attributes** — populate any custom fields configured for sales documents.

Keyboard: `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` to save, `Escape` to cancel dialogs.

## Tips

- Use quotes for negotiation or draft carts, then convert to orders once confirmed.
- Keep numbering tokens predictable (see Sales settings → Document numbers).
- Address validation follows your dictionary-backed address types and editing guards.
