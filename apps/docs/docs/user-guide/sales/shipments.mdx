Shipments track fulfillment against orders. Each shipment can apply shipping costs, set tracking, and update item statuses. Access requires `sales.shipments.manage` plus order manage rights.

## Create a shipment

1) Open the **Shipments** tab on an order; click **Add shipment**.  
2) Set **shipping method** (from Sales settings) and **shipment status** (dictionary-driven).  
3) Pick a **ship to** address or add a new one.  
4) Select **items to ship** and quantities.  
5) Optionally add a **shipping cost adjustment** so totals include carrier charges.  
6) Add notes and tracking numbers.  
7) Save with `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter`; `Escape` cancels.

## How shipments interact with items

- Item-level statuses move when quantities ship; statuses come from the Order line statuses dictionary.
- Multiple shipments can fulfill one order; remaining quantities stay pending.
- Shipping adjustments post to the Adjustments tab and recalc totals.

## Tips

- Keep **shipment statuses** tidy (pending, packed, shipped, delivered, returned) to mirror warehouse workflows.
- Use notes for packing instructions; tracking supports multiple numbers (comma-separated).
- Add shipping cost adjustments per shipment to keep margins accurate.
