Editing keeps documents accurate without breaking audit trails. Guardrails from Sales settings control when customers or addresses can change.

## What you can edit

- **Customer and primary email** — swap the customer; addresses reset to prevent mixing data.
- **Channel and currency** — adjust if the sale moves to a different store or currency.
- **Status** — pick from your order or quote status dictionaries; guards may block changes at certain stages.
- **Addresses** — update shipping/billing, define new ones, or unlink “Same as shipping”.
- **Items** — add or edit lines from the Items tab; totals update immediately.
- **Comments** — keep an internal thread for handoffs.

## Guardrails

- **Editing guards** (Sales settings) define whether customers/addresses can change at any status or only while Draft.
- **Status transitions** follow your configured dictionaries; some workflows restrict backwards moves.
- **Recalculation** — any change to items, adjustments, shipments, or payments updates totals automatically.

## Keyboard and UX

- Dialogs follow shared shortcuts: `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` to save, `Escape` to close.
- Inline edits are feature-guarded by `sales.orders.manage` / `sales.quotes.manage`.
