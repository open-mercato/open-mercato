Adjustments let you add charges or discounts without editing line items. They support percentage or fixed amounts and respect tax classes. Access requires order/quote manage plus `sales.settings.manage` to curate kinds and tax rates.

4) Pick **calculation mode**: Percentage or Fixed amount.  
5) Enter **rate** or **net/gross amount**; select a **tax class** if applicable.

## How adjustments roll into totals

- Each adjustment contributes to subtotals and grand totals based on kind and tax class.
- Shipping and surcharge entries increase totals; discounts reduce them; tax adjustments apply the selected rate or amounts.
- Order detail shows grouped totals (net, gross, discounts, surcharges, tax) for transparency.

## Tips

- Predefine **Adjustment kinds** in Sales settings so operators pick from curated options.
- Use **percentage** for promos tied to the subtotal; use **fixed amount** for fees like “Stripe processing”.
- Keep tax classes aligned with your catalog pricing for consistent VAT handling.
