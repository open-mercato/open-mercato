Use Sales settings to standardize how orders and quotes behave. Access requires `sales.settings.manage`.

## Document numbers

- Configure **order** and **quote** number formats with tokens like `{yyyy}`, `{mm}`, `{dd}`, `{seq:5}`, `{kind}`.
- Control the **next sequence** per type; sequences are scoped per organization.
- Tokens can combine for readable IDs (e.g., `ORDER-{yyyy}/{seq:5}`).

## Editing guards

- Decide when **customers** and **addresses** can change (any status vs only draft).
- Changing customer clears addresses to prevent data mix-ups.

## Payment methods and statuses

![Payment methods](/screenshots/open-mercato-orders-settings-payment-methods.png)

- **Payment methods** list providers (e.g., Cash on Delivery, Bank Transfer, Card) and active flag.
- **Payment statuses** define lifecycle (authorized, captured, pending, received, refunded, failed, canceled).
- Both power the Payments tab and keep reports consistent.

## Shipping methods and shipment statuses

- **Shipping methods** capture provider, base rate, and active flag; used when creating shipments and shipping adjustments.
- **Shipment statuses** cover fulfillment states (pending, packed, shipped, in_transit, delivered, returned, canceled).

## Order statuses and line statuses

- **Order statuses** control the main document lifecycle (draft, confirmed, in_fulfillment, fulfilled, on_hold, canceled).
- **Order line statuses** refine per-line fulfillment (pending, picking, packed, shipped, delivered, returned, backordered, allocated).

## Adjustment kinds

- Curate reusable kinds (Discount, Shipping, Tax, Surcharge, Custom). Kinds drive the adjustment dialog and reporting.

## Tax rates

- Maintain VAT/tax classes with code, rate, and default flag. Applied to items and adjustments for consistent totals.

## Tips

- Keep naming consistent across methods, statuses, and kinds so operators pick confidently.
- Review guards before go-live to prevent mid-fulfillment edits that could break compliance.
- Align tax classes with catalog pricing and finance reporting.
