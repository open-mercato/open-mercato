Items capture what was sold, in what quantity, and at which price. Edits flow into totals, shipments, and status tracking.

## Manage line items

- Open the **Items** tab to add products, set quantities, and adjust pricing.
- Line-level statuses (from **Order line statuses**) track fulfillment stages such as pending, picking, packed, shipped, delivered, returned.
- Item edits recalc subtotals and downstream adjustments automatically.

## Best practices

- Keep line statuses aligned with your warehouse states so shipment updates stay clear.
- Use discounts via **Adjustments** rather than manual price edits to preserve margin visibility.
- If catalog pricing differs by channel, ensure the order’s channel reflects the right offer before adding items.
