Payments attach financial events to orders and quotes, feeding totals and outstanding balance. Access requires `sales.payments.manage` plus order/quote manage rights.

## Add or update a payment

- Open the **Payments** tab on an order or quote and click **Add payment**.
- Enter the **amount** (document currency is preset), choose a **payment method**, and pick a **status** (authorized, captured, pending, etc.).
- Optionally set **reference**, **received at**, and trigger a status change on the underlying order/quote.
- Save with `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter`; `Escape` cancels.

## How payments affect totals

- **Captured/received** amounts reduce the outstanding balance.
- **Refunded** entries increase refunded totals and adjust outstanding accordingly.
- Each payment stores its method and status from your dictionaries so reporting stays consistent.

## Tips

- Use **Bank transfer** + **Pending** for manual settlements; flip to **Received** once funds arrive.
- Capture multiple payments on a single document; totals aggregate across entries.
- Keep methods and statuses curated under Sales settings → Payment methods / Payment statuses.
