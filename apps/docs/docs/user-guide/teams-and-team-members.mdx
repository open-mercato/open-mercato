The **Employees** workspace keeps your organization structure tidy. Teams give you a logical grouping, and team members capture the operational profile for each person, including roles, tags, custom fields, and attachments.

## Teams

- **Create teams** in **Employees -> Teams** to represent departments, squads, or delivery pods.
- **Add descriptions** so stakeholders understand the focus of each team.
- **Open a team** to manage members directly from the team detail screen.

- **Browse all members** in **Employees -> Team members** to see team assignment, roles, and tags at a glance.
- **Filter and search** to find the right person fast, especially when managing large organizations.
- **Use tags** to capture skills, specialties, or certifications without changing the data model.

## Editing team members

- **Assign a user** to connect the profile with a login identity.
- **Set roles** to reflect the employee role catalog (for example, backend engineer or product manager).
- **Capture custom fields** from the right-hand fieldsets, such as compensation, employment details, or work preferences.
- **Upload attachments** like resumes, certifications, or onboarding documents to keep the profile complete.

## Notes, activities, and availability

- **Add notes and activities** to record check-ins, performance updates, or workflow-relevant events.
- **Track availability** in the profile so schedulers know when a team member is available.

## Access control

- **View access** requires `staff.view`.
- **Create and edit access** for teams, members, roles, and tags requires `staff.manage_team`.
- Combine staff features with organization scope to keep tenant data isolated.
