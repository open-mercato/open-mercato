title: Leave requests and availability
description: Submit leave requests, approve them as an admin, and keep personal availability up to date.

Open Mercato separates personal leave workflows from manager approval views, so employees can self-serve while admins retain oversight.

## My leave requests

- **Open** **Employees -> My leave requests** to see your personal history and submit new leave requests.
- **Track status** (pending, approved, declined) without exposing other team members' data.
- **Edit or cancel** a request before it is processed, depending on your organization rules.

## Admin leave requests

- **Open** **Employees -> Leave requests** to review the org-wide queue.
- **Approve or decline** requests to keep capacity accurate and ensure staffing coverage.
- **Review request details** such as team member, date range, reason, and notes before making a decision.

## Request workflow

- **Submit** a request from the personal view.
- **Await review** by a manager with leave management permissions.
- **Receive a decision** that updates the request status and appears in the audit trail.

## My availability

- **Set weekly hours** to define your default availability.
- **Add date-specific hours** for exceptions, sick days, or planned time off.
- **Use unavailability reasons** to clarify the context for schedule changes.

## Access control

- **Personal leave access** uses `staff.my_leave_requests.view` and `staff.my_leave_requests.send`.
- **Manager access** requires `staff.leave_requests.manage` to approve or decline requests, plus `staff.leave_requests.send` to submit on behalf of others.
- **Availability access** uses `staff.my_availability.view`, `staff.my_availability.manage`, and `staff.my_availability.unavailability`.
