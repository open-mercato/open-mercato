## Avoid identity-map stale snapshots in command logs

**Context**: Command `buildLog()` in multiple modules loaded the "after" snapshot using the same non-forked `EntityManager` used earlier in `prepare()`. MikroORM's identity map returned cached entities, so `snapshotAfter` matched `snapshotBefore`.

**Problem**: Audit logs showed identical before/after snapshots even when updates occurred, because the EM cache was reused.

**Rule**: In `buildLog()`, always load snapshots using a forked `EntityManager` (or explicitly `refresh: true`). This guarantees a fresh DB read and avoids identity-map caching in logs.

**Applies to**: Any command that captures `snapshotBefore` in `prepare()` and later loads `snapshotAfter` in `buildLog()`.
