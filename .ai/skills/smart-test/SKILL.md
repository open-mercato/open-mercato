# Smart Test — Run Only Affected Tests

Runs the minimal set of tests that cover the code changes in the current branch or working tree.

**Execution policy**: Display the test plan (which tests will run and why), then **immediately run them without asking for confirmation**.

**Cache**: Analysis results are persisted to `.test-cache.json` (gitignored). On repeated invocations for the same commit with no uncommitted changes, the cached plan is reused — skip straight to running tests.

## Two Test Types, Two Strategies

| Type | Files | Strategy |
|------|-------|----------|
| Jest (unit/component) | `*.test.ts`, `*.test.tsx` | `--findRelatedTests` (Jest traverses import graph) |
| Playwright (integration) | `*.spec.ts` in `__integration__/` | Module-name matching via `meta.ts` dependency declarations |

---

## Step 0 — Cache Lookup

Before doing any git analysis, check whether a valid cached plan already exists for the current state.

```bash
CURRENT_HASH=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
UNCOMMITTED=$(git diff --name-only HEAD; git ls-files --others --exclude-standard)
```

Read `.test-cache.json` (if it exists). The cache is **valid** when:
1. `cache.commitHash` equals `CURRENT_HASH`, **and**
2. `UNCOMMITTED` is empty (no staged/unstaged/untracked changes), **and**
3. The commit is reachable from HEAD: `git merge-base --is-ancestor <cache.commitHash> HEAD 2>/dev/null` exits 0

```bash
git merge-base --is-ancestor "${cache.commitHash}" HEAD 2>/dev/null && echo "reachable" || echo "stale"
```

Condition 3 guards against stale cache entries after a rebase, amend, or force-push. The old hash may still exist as a dangling object in the git store (`git cat-file -e` would return true), but it is no longer part of the branch history — `git merge-base --is-ancestor` correctly rejects it.

**If cache is valid**: skip Steps 1–5, print `[cache hit: <hash>]`, and proceed directly to running tests using `cache.jestSourceFiles` and `cache.integrationSpecFiles`.

**If cache is invalid or missing**: continue to Step 1. After completing Steps 1–2, write the cache (see "Save Cache" below) before running tests.

### Cache file format (`.test-cache.json`)

```json
{
  "commitHash": "<git rev-parse HEAD>",
  "savedAt": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "scope": "module | wide | test-only | package",
  "layer": "ui | ui-component | api-logic | data | mixed",
  "affectedModules": ["auth", "sales"],
  "jestSourceFiles": [
    "packages/core/src/modules/auth/commands/users.ts"
  ],
  "integrationSpecFiles": [
    "packages/core/src/modules/auth/__integration__/TC-AUTH-001.spec.ts"
  ],
  "integrationWide": false
}
```

`integrationWide: true` means the Python script returned `--all`; in that case `integrationSpecFiles` is empty and the full integration suite runs.

`layer` values: `ui` = skip Playwright; `ui-component`, `api-logic`, `data`, or `mixed` = run Playwright.

### Save Cache

After completing the analysis (Steps 1–2), write the plan before running tests:

```bash
node -e "
const fs = require('fs');
const plan = {
  commitHash: '$(git rev-parse HEAD)',
  savedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  scope: '<scope>',
  layer: '<ui|ui-component|api-logic|data|mixed>',
  affectedModules: <json-array-of-modules>,
  jestSourceFiles: <json-array>,
  integrationSpecFiles: <json-array>,
  integrationWide: <true|false>
};
fs.writeFileSync('.test-cache.json', JSON.stringify(plan, null, 2));
"
```

---

## Step 1 — Determine Changed Files

Build one changed-file list and reuse it for cache invalidation, classification, Jest, and
Playwright mapping. Include PR diff, local staged/unstaged changes, and untracked files:

First resolve the comparison base. Do **not** guess `origin/main` when the branch is based on
`develop`; comparing a develop-based branch to `origin/main` can pull in unrelated
`packages/shared/` changes from the long-lived develop branch and incorrectly force the full
suite.

```bash
BASE_REF="${SMART_TEST_BASE_REF:-}"
if [ -z "$BASE_REF" ]; then
  BASE_REF="$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{upstream} 2>/dev/null || true)"
fi
if [ -z "$BASE_REF" ] && git rev-parse --verify --quiet origin/develop >/dev/null; then
  if git merge-base --fork-point origin/develop HEAD >/dev/null 2>&1 || git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/develop HEAD; then
    BASE_REF="origin/develop"
  fi
fi
if [ -z "$BASE_REF" ] && git rev-parse --verify --quiet develop >/dev/null; then
  if git merge-base --fork-point develop HEAD >/dev/null 2>&1 || git merge-base --is-ancestor develop HEAD; then
    BASE_REF="develop"
  fi
fi

CHANGED_FILES=$({
  if [ -n "$BASE_REF" ]; then
    git diff --name-only "$BASE_REF"...HEAD
  fi
  git diff --name-only HEAD
  git ls-files --others --exclude-standard
} | awk '!seen[$0]++')
```

If `git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD` contains `packages/shared/` but `$BASE_REF` is
`origin/develop`/`develop` and the `$BASE_REF...HEAD` diff does not contain
`packages/shared/`, do not classify the branch as wide-scope. Report it as a base-ref
mismatch and use the resolved develop base.

If there is no upstream PR context, use only local changes and untracked files:

```bash
CHANGED_FILES=$({
  git diff --name-only HEAD
  git ls-files --others --exclude-standard
} | awk '!seen[$0]++')
```

---

## Step 2 — Classify Scope and Layer

### 2a — Scope

Read the changed file list and classify scope:

- **Wide scope** (run everything): changes in `packages/shared/`, `packages/events/`, `packages/queue/`, `packages/cache/`, root `jest.config.cjs`, `jest.setup.ts`, `tsconfig*.json`
- **UI-wide**: changes in `packages/ui/src/` (not inside a module subfolder)
- **Module-scoped**: `packages/*/src/modules/<module>/` or `apps/mercato/src/modules/<module>/` → extract `<module>`
- **Package-scoped** (no module): `packages/<pkg>/src/lib/` or `packages/<pkg>/src/` root — treat as wide scope for that package
- **Test-only changes**: `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` files changed → run those specific files directly

See `references/test-architecture.md` for module extraction patterns and known cross-module integration dependencies.

### 2b — Layer (determines whether Playwright runs)

After determining scope, classify the **layer** of each changed source file. Integration (Playwright) tests only need to run when backend logic or data is touched — they are irrelevant for pure UI changes.

**Classify each changed file:**

| Layer | Path indicators | Playwright needed? |
|-------|----------------|--------------------|
| `ui` | `**/*.css` · `packages/ui/src/primitives/` · `packages/ui/src/styles/` | **No** |
| `ui-component` | `packages/ui/src/backend/**/*.tsx` · `/components/` · `/widgets/` · `/frontend/` · `/backend/**/*.tsx` (Next.js pages) | **Yes** — Playwright renders full pages; a broken component can crash a page load or break a selector |
| `api-logic` | `/api/` · `/commands/` · `/lib/` · `/services/` · `/subscribers/` · `/workers/` · `events.ts` · `notifications.ts` · `ai-tools.ts` | **Yes** |
| `data` | `/data/entities` · `/data/migrations` · `/data/validators` · `/data/extensions` · `/data/enrichers` | **Yes** |

**Layer decision rule:**
- All changed files → `ui` only (CSS / design tokens / primitives) → **skip Playwright**
- Any file → `ui-component` / `api-logic` / `data` → **run Playwright**
- Wide scope always → **run everything**

**Why `ui-component` needs Playwright**: integration tests render full pages. A React component that throws during render, a conditional that hides a button, or a changed DOM structure can all break Playwright selectors — even without touching any API.

**Only skip Playwright when** the change cannot affect DOM structure or interactivity: pure CSS, design tokens, Tailwind config, color/spacing primitives.

**Special cases:**
- Module `backend/page.tsx`, `backend/[id]/page.tsx` — Next.js page files → `ui-component` (Playwright visits these pages)
- Module `api/GET/route.ts`, `api/POST/route.ts` → API routes → `api-logic`

→ **Save cache now** (see Step 0 — Save Cache, include `layer` field) before proceeding to run tests.

---

## Step 3 — Jest Unit Tests

Use Jest's built-in `--findRelatedTests`. It traverses the import graph from changed source files and discovers every test that (directly or transitively) imports them.

```bash
# Build the list of changed source files (exclude test files themselves)
CHANGED=$(printf '%s\n' "$CHANGED_FILES" \
  | grep -E '\.(ts|tsx)$' \
  | grep -v '\.test\.' \
  | grep -v '\.spec\.' \
  | grep -v '__tests__/' \
  | grep -v '__integration__/' \
  | tr '\n' ' ')

# Run related tests (passWithNoTests handles no-match gracefully)
yarn jest --findRelatedTests $CHANGED --passWithNoTests
```

**Wide scope fallback**: when `CHANGED` includes shared/events/queue/cache files, run the full Jest suite instead:

```bash
yarn test
```

---

## Step 4 — Ensure Server Is Running (Integration Tests Only)

Before running any Playwright tests, verify the app is accessible on port 3000.

```bash
curl -sf http://localhost:3000 > /dev/null 2>&1
```

**If the server is running** (exit code 0): proceed directly to Step 5.

**If the server is NOT running**: build the project and start the production server:

```bash
# Build everything (packages + app)
yarn build

# Start production server in background
yarn start &
APP_PID=$!

# Wait up to 2 minutes for server to become ready
echo "Waiting for server on port 3000..."
for i in $(seq 1 60); do
  curl -sf http://localhost:3000 > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "Server ready." && break
  sleep 2
done
```

After tests finish, leave the server running — do not kill it.

---

## Step 5 — Integration Tests (Playwright)

**Layer gate**: if `layer = ui` (all changed files are UI-only), skip this step entirely — Playwright tests are not affected by pure UI changes.

Otherwise, use the Python script to map changed modules → affected spec files.
Pass `--layer` so the script can apply the correct triggering rules:

```bash
SPEC_FILES=$(printf '%s\n' "$CHANGED_FILES" \
  | python3 .ai/skills/smart-test/scripts/find_affected_integration_tests.py \
    --project-root . \
    --base auto \
    --layer "$LAYER")

if [ "$SPEC_FILES" = "--all" ]; then
  yarn test:integration
elif [ -n "$SPEC_FILES" ]; then
  yarn playwright test $SPEC_FILES --config=.ai/qa/tests/playwright.config.ts
else
  echo "No affected integration tests found."
fi
```

`$LAYER` is the value determined in Step 2b (`ui-component`, `api-logic`, `data`, or `mixed`).

**Layer-aware dep filtering**: when `LAYER=ui-component`, the script only runs tests whose
own module changed — it ignores cross-module `dependsOnModules` declarations. Rationale: a
changed `page.tsx` or React component cannot break another module's API calls; only tests
that actually visit those pages need to run.

**Workspace scoping**: the script compares module identity by both module name and runtime
root. For example, `apps/mercato/src/modules/example` and
`packages/create-app/template/src/modules/example` are separate `example` modules, so an
app-specific page change does not trigger template integration specs.

**Wide scope**: if the script outputs `--all` (triggered when shared deps changed), run the full integration suite.

**Data layer**: if `layer = data` (entities/migrations changed), integration tests are
particularly important. Run normally via the script — the mapping will include all tests for
the affected module including any that declare it as a dependency.

---

## Step 6 — Report Results

After tests complete, summarize:
- Whether results came from cache (`[cache hit]`) or fresh analysis
- How many Jest tests ran vs full suite
- Which integration spec files ran and why (which changed module triggered each)
- Whether the server was already running or was built and started
- Any wide-scope fallback applied and why

**Coverage percentages** (always include at the end):

| Type | Ran | Total | % |
|------|-----|-------|---|
| Unit (Jest suites) | `<ran>` | ~485 | `<ran/485 * 100>`% |
| Integration (Playwright spec files) | `<ran>` | ~323 | `<ran/323 * 100>`% |

Totals come from `references/test-architecture.md`. Round to one decimal place.

## Decision Tree

```
Step 0: .test-cache.json valid (hash + no uncommitted + reachable)?
  └─ YES → use cached plan, skip to running tests
  └─ NO  → analyze:

       Step 2a — Scope:
         └─ Only test files?         → Run those files directly (skip integration check)
         └─ shared/events/queue/cache/root config?
                                     → Full suite (yarn test + yarn test:integration)
         └─ Module-scoped?           → extract module name(s)
         └─ Package lib (no module)? → --findRelatedTests for that package

       Step 2b — Layer (for non-wide, non-test-only scopes):
         └─ ALL files are pure CSS / design tokens / primitives (layer = ui)?
              → Jest: --findRelatedTests <changed-src-files>
              → Integration: SKIP (no DOM structure change possible)
         └─ ANY file is ui-component / api-logic / data?
              → Jest: --findRelatedTests <changed-src-files>
              → Integration: check server → script maps modules → spec files

       → Save cache (with layer field) → run tests
```
