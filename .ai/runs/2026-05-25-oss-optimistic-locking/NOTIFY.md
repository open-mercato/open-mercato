## 2026-05-25T10:50Z — auto-continue-pr-loop resume
- Resumed by: @pkarw
- Resume point: 7.1 (source: PLAN.md Tasks table — first todo row)
- PR head SHA: 7f98bfe47
- Migrated legacy flat-file plan `.ai/runs/2026-05-25-oss-optimistic-locking.md` into a per-spec folder per `auto-continue-pr-loop` step 1 contract.
- Resume scope: Phases 7–11 (customers.person, sales.order, CrudForm prop, useGuardedMutation flash, end-to-end wiring on customers.company edit page).
- User directive: every commit that touches UI gets a paired UI test.

## 2026-05-25T11:00Z — checkpoint 1
- Steps verified: 7.1, 7.2, 8.1, 8.2 (SHA range 23b28c066..ff7841453).
- Decision: introduced `optimistic-lock-store.ts` (Step 8.1) to resolve the Awilix `crudMutationGuardService` last-write-wins risk between customers and sales modules. Spec PLAN.md Risks block updated.
- UI verification: **skipped** — no UI files touched in window. Expected at next checkpoint after Phase 9 (CrudForm prop).
- Validation: 27/27 shared optimistic-lock + 10/10 ui helpers pass; i18n in sync; 0 new typecheck errors.
