## 2026-04-18T00:00:00Z — run started
- Brief: AI framework unification. First task of this PR: rework `auto-create-pr` + `auto-continue-pr` skills (and siblings) to use per-spec run folders with PLAN/HANDOFF/NOTIFY + per-commit proofs + 2-subagent cap.
- External skill URLs: none.
- Phase 2+ scope: deferred until Phase 1 lands and the user provides direction.

## 2026-04-18T00:00:00Z — decision: run in primary worktree
- The updated `auto-create-pr` skill requires an isolated worktree. The user explicitly asked to continue working in the primary worktree ("we'll continue in this branch").
- Decision: honor the user's direction. Treat this as a one-time dogfooding deviation. Future runs that follow the skill by the book will use `.ai/tmp/auto-create-pr/`.
- Mitigation: documented in `PLAN.md` Risks; no data loss risk because the only edits are under `.ai/skills/` and `.ai/runs/`.

## 2026-04-18T00:00:00Z — decision: skip Playwright for Step 1.1
- Step 1.1 is a docs-only change to `.ai/skills/*.md` and `.ai/runs/README.md`. No UI surface, no runtime behavior. Per the new skill rules, UI/browser verification is N/A for this Step.
- Typecheck + unit tests are likewise N/A because no TypeScript/JS source changed. Proof for Step 1.1 is the diff itself plus a short `proofs/1.1/notes.md` summary.

## 2026-04-18T00:00:00Z — branch created
- Branch: `feat/ai-framework-unification` off `develop` at HEAD.
- Working tree carries the Step 1.1 edits ready to be committed after the run folder lands.
