# Data Model and Extensibility

Entities are per-module, with custom fields and links for cross-module data.

```mermaid
erDiagram
  TENANTS ||--o{ ORGANIZATIONS : scopes
  ORGANIZATIONS ||--o{ CORE_ENTITY : owns
  CORE_ENTITY ||--o{ CUSTOM_FIELD_VALUE : has
  CUSTOM_ENTITY ||--o{ CUSTOM_FIELD_VALUE : has
  MODULE_LINK ||--o{ CORE_ENTITY : links
```

- No cross-module ORM relations; use foreign key IDs
- Custom fields live in the entities module (EAV)
- Extensions are declared via `data/extensions.ts`

:::notes
Explain how module isolation is maintained by design, and how custom fields and extension links let teams add data without rewriting core tables.
