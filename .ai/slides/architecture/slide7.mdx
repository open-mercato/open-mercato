# Module Anatomy and Auto-Discovery

Modules are self-contained, with predictable entry points and naming.

```text
src/modules/<module>/
  frontend/    -> /<path>
  backend/     -> /backend/<path>
  api/<method>/ -> /api/<path>
  data/        -> entities, validators, extensions
  widgets/     -> injection widgets
  workers/     -> background jobs
  subscribers/ -> event handlers
```

- Page metadata lives in `page.meta.ts` or `metadata` exports
- API routes export `openApi` for docs and tooling
- Registries are generated by `npm run modules:prepare`

:::notes
Point out the discovery rules and how this keeps modules isomorphic. Call out that modules do not reach into each other directly and communicate through links, widgets, or events.
