## Enterprise Edition (Commercial) Notes

Specifications located in `.ai/specs/enterprise/` describe commercial Open Mercato features that are not released under the open source license.

You may evaluate and use these Enterprise Edition features optionally for non-production developer purposes only.

Without a valid commercial license from Catch The Tornado, you may not:
- use Enterprise Edition features in production,
- use Enterprise Edition features for commercial purposes,
- reproduce, redistribute, or sublicense Enterprise Edition code or specifications,
- modify, refactor, derive, or generate new features from Enterprise Edition implementations.

For enterprise license terms, permissions, and partnership model details, see [`packages/enterprise/README.md`](../../packages/enterprise/README.md).
