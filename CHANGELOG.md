# 0.3.0 (2025-11-31)

## Highlights
- Consolidated modular architecture across auth, customers, sales, dictionaries, query index, and vector search modules.
- Delivered multi-tenant RBAC, CLI scaffolding, and extensibility primitives for module discovery and entity customization.
- Added query index and vector pipelines with coverage monitoring, incremental re-indexing, and pgvector driver support.
- Hardened CRM workflows (tasks, todos, deals, dictionaries, custom data) and sales configuration (catalog, pricing, tax, shipping).
- Stabilized CRUD factories, undo/redo command bus, and background subscribers for predictable data sync.

## Improvements

- Enhanced validation, custom field handling, and locale support across UI surfaces.

## Fixes
- Resolved dictionary filtering, customer coverage, ACL feature flags, and access log retention issues.
- Addressed form validation, undo/redo edge cases, and task linkage bugs across CRM pages.
- Improved type safety in API routes, CLI commands, and MikroORM entities.

## Tooling
- Added OpenAPI generator updates and shared registry cleanup.
- Hardened migrations for dictionaries, sales, and query index modules.
