# 0.3.3 (2025-11-16)

## Improvements 
- Catalog UI pages - create products page, product price kind settings
- Shifted catalog product attributes onto custom-field fieldsets so vertical-specific definitions travel through CRUD forms, filters, and APIs without bespoke schema code.
- Product edit view now lists variant prices with inline edit/delete controls for quicker maintenance.
- Fixed product edit validation crashes and restricted variant actions to the proper ACL feature to avoid forced re-auth on delete.
- Added variant auto-generation and lighter edit page cards, and fixed the edit link routing for catalog variants.
- Channel offer form now surfaces a validation error if a price override is missing its price kind selection.
- `mercato init` seeds default USD regular and sale price kinds configured as tax-inclusive overrides.

# 0.3.0 (2025-10-31)

## Highlights
- Consolidated modular architecture across auth, customers, sales, dictionaries, query index, and vector search modules.
- Delivered multi-tenant RBAC, CLI scaffolding, and extensibility primitives for module discovery and entity customization.
- Added query index and vector pipelines with coverage monitoring, incremental re-indexing, and pgvector driver support.
- Hardened CRM workflows (tasks, todos, deals, dictionaries, custom data) and sales configuration (catalog, pricing, tax, shipping).
- Stabilized CRUD factories, undo/redo command bus, and background subscribers for predictable data sync.

## Improvements
- Standardized API endpoints, backend pages, and CLI entries for each module.
- Expanded documentation for the framework API, query index, and module guides.
- Introduced profiling flags, coverage metrics, and engine optimizations for faster indexing.
- Enhanced validation, custom field handling, and locale support across UI surfaces.


## Fixes
- Resolved dictionary filtering, customer coverage, ACL feature flags, and access log retention issues.
- Addressed form validation, undo/redo edge cases, and task linkage bugs across CRM pages.
- Improved type safety in API routes, CLI commands, and MikroORM entities.

## Tooling
- Added OpenAPI generator updates and shared registry cleanup.
- Hardened migrations for dictionaries, sales, and query index modules.
- Synchronized vector service CLI, background subscribers, and reindex tooling.
