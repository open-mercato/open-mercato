# Contributing to Open Mercato

Weâ€™re excited to collaborate with folks building on top of Open Mercato. This guide explains how we organize releases, structure branches, and prepare pull requests so changes land smoothly.

## Branch Model

- `main` â€“ release-ready code. Every commit is tagged and deployable. Keep PRs targeting `main` limited to hotfixes or release prep approved by maintainers.
- `develop` â€“ nightly builds and upcoming release work. Base regular feature work off `develop` so it can soak in automation and shared testing.
- Topic branches â€“ create a dedicated branch per change using the format `feat/<concise-feature-name>` (for example `feat/customer-export`). Use other prefixes when appropriate (`fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/`).

## Working on Features

- Branch from `develop`, keeping it up to date via `git pull --rebase origin develop`.
- Keep commits scoped and descriptive. Squash locally if it clarifies the story.
- Follow module conventions from [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and prefer the `packages/` workspace for new code.
- Document user-facing copy in the locale dictionaries and keep translations in sync.

## Pull Requests

- Open PRs against `develop` unless you are coordinating a release hotfix.
- Describe the user impact, architectural notes, and testing performed (lint, unit, integration, CLI).
- Ensure the branch merges cleanly and CI is green before requesting review.
- Reference related issues or discussions; add screenshots or recordings for UI tweaks.
- Tag maintainers early if you need design or architectural guidance.
